**Information Frictions in Credit Markets** <span style="color: gray; font-size:0.9em; line-height:1em;"> Draft coming soon  </span> 

**Technological Change and Domestic Outsourcing**  <span style="color: gray;"> with [Antonin Bergeaud](https://sites.google.com/site/abergeaudeco), [Clément Malgouyres](https://sites.google.com/site/clementmalgouyres/) and [Sara Signorelli](https://sites.google.com/view/sarasignorelli/home).</span> 

<span style="color: gray; font-size:0.9em; line-height:1em;"> **Abstract** : Domestic outsourcing has grown substantially in developed countries over the past two decades. While some studies document its implications for earnings inequality, very little is known regarding the drivers of this phenomenon. This paper addresses this question by studying the impact of the staggered diffusion of broadband internet on job outsourcing by French firms. We show that BI led firms to outsource some non-core occupations to service contractors, both in the low and high skill segment. In both cases, we find that employment related to these occupations become increasingly concentrated in firms specializing in these activities, and less likely to become performed in-house within firms specialized in other activities. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence that high-skill workers experience salary gains from being outsourced, while low-skill workers lose. </span>

**Bank Local Specialization** <span style="color: gray;"> with [Anne Duquerroy](https://sites.google.com/site/anneduquerroy/),  [Jean-Stéphane Mésonnier](http://jsmeson.pagesperso-orange.fr/) and [Daniel Paravisini](https://sites.google.com/site/paravisinidaniel/home).</span>

<span style="color: gray; font-size:0.9em; line-height:1em;"> **Abstract** : Using micro-data of the universe of bank-SME relationships in France, we show that banks specialize locally (at the branch level) by industry, and that this specialization shapes the equilibrium amount of borrowing by small firms. For identification, we exploit the reallocation of local clients from closing branches to nearby branches of the same bank, which induced quasi-random variation in the match between a firm's industry and industry of specialization of the branch. We show that branch reallocation leads, on average, to a substantial and permanent decline in small firm borrowing. This decline is fully explained by firms whose accounts were reallocated from branches less specialized in their industry than the original one. Consistently with previous studies, we observe a significant drop in the supply of credit to small borrowers around the date of the closing. However, the effect of the closing almost doubles when the firm's account is transferred from a branch which was specialized in lending to its industry to a new, non-specialized, branch of the same bank.  </span>

**Aggregate Implications of Credit Relationship Flows: A Tale of Two Margins** <span style="color: gray;"> with [Yasser Boualam](http://www.yasserboualam.com/).</span>

<span style="color: gray; font-size:0.9em; line-height:1em;"> **Abstract** : This paper documents the aggregate properties of credit relationship flows within the commercial loan market in France between 1998 and 2018. Using detailed bank-firm level data from the French Credit Register, we show that banks actively and continuously adjust their credit supply along both intensive and extensive margins. We particularly highlight the importance of gross flows associated with credit relationships and show that they are (i) volatile and pervasive throughout the cycle, and (ii) can account for up to 48 percent of the cyclical and 90 percent of the long-run variations in aggregate bank credit. </span>

**Technology-Induced Trade Shocks ? Evidence from Broadband Internet Expansion in France** <span style="color: gray;"> with [Clément Malgouyres](https://sites.google.com/site/clementmalgouyres/) and [Thierry Mayer](https://sites.google.com/site/thierrymayer/home). </span>

<span style="color: gray; font-size:0.9em; line-height:1em;"> **Abstract** : In this paper, we test for the presence of “technology-induced” trade in France between 2000 and 2007 and assess its impact on consumer welfare. We use the staggered roll-out of broadband internet to estimate its causal impact on the importing behavior of firms. Using an event-study design, we find that broadband expansion increases imports. Our estimates imply that the increase in the value of imports in the absence of broadband expansion would have been a 15% lower. We further find that the sub-extensive margin (number of products and sourcing country per firm) is the main margin of adjustment and that the impact is higher for capital goods. Finally, we develop a firm-based model of importing and adopt a sufficient statistics approach in order to quantify the contribution of the import-channel to the overall effect of broadband on consumer welfare. Within this model, our reduced-form estimates imply that broadband internet reduced the consumer price index by 1.7% and that the import-channel accounts for a quarter of that effect. </span>

**Investment and the WACC: Firm-Level Evidence from France** <span style="color: gray;"> with [Juan Carluccio](http://juancarluccio.com/) and [Jean-Stéphane Mésonnier](http://jsmeson.pagesperso-orange.fr/).</span>    
<span style="color: gray;">**R&R at European Journal of Finance**</span> 

<span style="color: gray; font-size:0.9em; line-height:1em;"> **Abstract** : We exploit a new dataset of consolidated balance sheets for some 1,850 private
French corporate groups, in order to investigate the relationship between corporate investment and the cost of capital. We notably construct firm-level measures of the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) that account for industry-specific values of the cost of equity and reflect the actual capital structure of firms. We find that a high WACC drags down investment: a one SD increase in the real WACC (+2 pp) is associated on average with a reduction by 0.65 pp in the investment rate. </span>

**Political Uncertainty, Risk of Frexit and European Sovereign Spreads** <span style="color: gray;"> with [Clément Malgouyres](https://sites.google.com/site/clementmalgouyres/). </span>    
<span style="color: gray;"> **Applied Economics Letters (2018)**  </span>  

<span style="color: gray; font-size:0.9em; line-height:1em;"> **Abstract** : Using data from a prediction market (crowd-based forecasts), we build a daily measure capturing the risk of Frexit related to the 2017 French presidential elections. We study how unexpected changes in this new measure of political uncertainty in France affect European sovereign spreads vis-à-vis Germany. We show that our uncertainty proxy drives not only the French sovereign spread but also the spreads of those EU countries deemed the most vulnerable to the risk of desegregation of the Euro Zone. These results suggest that specific political uncertainty affects short-term investors expectations and may outweigh other economic determinants of sovereign spreads shortly prior to high stake elections </span>
